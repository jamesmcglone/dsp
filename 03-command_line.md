###Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh` 
`ls -lah` 
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

> > 
```
`ls`  Lists files and directories at current or ~ location
`ls -a`  Lists all files, does not ignore those starting with '.'
`ls -l`  Lists files in long format (file name, size, modified date and time, author, permission, etc.)
`ls -lh` Difference with l is that sizes of files are 'human readable' (B, K, M etc.)
`ls -lah`  Same as above, but also includes files/directories beginning with '.'
`ls -t`  Sort by time, most recently modified
`ls -Glp`  List with color (CLICOLOR) based on file type in long format with backslashes at the end of directories
```
